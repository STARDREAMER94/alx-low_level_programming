 * positive_or_negative - function from project 00x01 repurposed

 * for every execution: a random value is assigned to variable n
 * print to see if variable n is positive or negative
 * variable n will store a different value every time program is ran
 * donâ€™t have to understand what rand, srand, RAND_MAX do.
 * The output of the program should be:
  *The number, followed by
  *if the number is greater than 0: is positive
  *if the number is 0: is zero
  *if the number is less than 0: is negative
  *followed by a new line
 * Return: Always 0 (success)
